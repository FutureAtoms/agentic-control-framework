Node.js v23.11.0
- File operations failed: [ERROR] No allowed directories configured
[ERROR] No allowed directories configured
FAILED: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')

## Configuration Tested

### CLI Configuration
- Direct command-line usage
- Task management workflows
- File and project operations

### Local MCP Configuration  
- Direct MCP server communication
- JSON-RPC protocol compliance
- Tool discovery and execution

### Cloud MCP Configuration
- mcp-proxy HTTP/SSE bridge
- Remote access capabilities
- Multiple client support

## Recommendations

1. **For Local Development**: Use CLI mode for direct task management
2. **For IDE Integration**: Use Local MCP mode with Cursor/Claude Desktop  
3. **For Cloud/Remote**: Use Cloud MCP mode with mcp-proxy
4. **For Browser Automation**: Ensure Playwright is properly installed
5. **For AppleScript** (macOS): Test system permissions for automation

## Next Steps

1. Address any failed tests identified above
2. Implement additional error handling where needed
3. Add performance benchmarking for heavy operations
4. Create automated CI/CD pipeline for regression testing
5. Document specific configuration requirements per tool
